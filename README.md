# Regression analysis using multiple models

This project focuses on building and evaluating various regression models to determine which algorithm performs best on a given dataset. It includes traditional machine learning models and a deep learning model using the Keras Sequential API.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess a regression dataset.
- Train and evaluate multiple regression models.
- Compare performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE, and R² Score.
- Conclude which model gives the best performance.
